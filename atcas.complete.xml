                    <note>Other editions are titled simply "The Casket," but this particular edition
                        is named after the publisher. The subtitle reads, "Flowers of Literature,
                        Wit, and Sentiment.</note>
                    <note>Atkinson’s Casket, Gems of Literature, Wit, and Sentiment, is just one edition of a book that functions as a compilation of short stories, poems, recipes, music, illustrations, and advice.  Including endearing and bewildering poetry, witty yet sometimes fatuous advice, and intriguing columns and fiction, this digital edition serves to give readers a glance into the everyday life of the early 1800s woman. With the disclosure of these specially selected pieces, this digital edition of Atkinson’s Casket delves into the real readings produced to shape the experiences of women in the 19th century. 
From folklore poetry to Greek philosophy, one of the key features highlighted in this digital edition of Atkinson’s Casket is its use and references towards well known tricky, witty, and clever women throughout each piece. In highlighting these women, this edition conclusively depicts not only the women sought after during this time, but also the power that the females themselves could hold. 
Along with this depiction of powerful women, Atkinson’s Casket also brings forth  an array of timely dialect and ideologies used to encompass the lives of the everyday woman. With the use of this pedantic and distinct vernacular, the texts succeeds in not only producing intriguing pieces, but also effectively illustrating the societal pressure and judgments that they were willed to succumb to each day. This dialect along with historical anecdotes and references permeates through the texts, making the harsh life bestowed upon the 19th century women both evident and abhorrent. 
This digital edition consummates with a piece of fiction encapsulating the ideal ways in which beauty and worth should be evaluated, along with the measures taken to attain them. With a twist of mystery, magic, and misogyny, the final piece outlines the story of a women who willingly changes skin each year to remain desirable. This aspiration for perpetual youth is a staple throughout the text and furthermore gives a final glance into the skin-crawling experiences that the women of the 1800s endured.

                <head type="title">Medusa.</head>
                <p>An intelligent physician of Philadelphia<note type="editorial">Philadelphia,
                        Pennsylvania, United States</note> has furnished the best account of the
                    Medusa, an order of animated beings but rarely described. We copy his account,
                    which will be found highly interesting and graphic.</p>
                <p>Those who have sought relief from the summer heats at Long Branch or Cape May,
                    have probably noticed, in their ramblings along the beach, certain gelatinous
                    transparent masses deposited by the receding tide on the sands. They resemble
                    very large plano-convex lenses, and are devoid of colour except in a few minute
                    points, which appear like grains of yellow sand, or the eggs of some shells
                    embedded in their substance. This has led many to consider them as the spawn of
                    some marine animal.</p>
                <p> If one of these jellies be placed in a tub of brine immediately after it reaches
                    the shore, the observer will be surprised to find it possessed of animation. The
                    superior, or convex part, will expand like the top of an umbrella; and from its
                    under surface several fringed and leaf-like membranes will be developed. The
                    remains of numerous threads, or tendrils, will float out form the margin of the
                    umbrella, following the motions of the animal as it swims around the tub. These
                    threads are often several feel in length before they are broken by the sand;
                    they are probably employed both to entice and to secure the prey, and they
                    produce a sharp stinging sensation, when applied to the skin. It is from the
                    appearance and offensive power of these last organs, that seamen have given the
                    animal the title of the sea-nettle, and naturalists the generic name Medusa.</p>
                <p>I have offered this rude description of the Medusa, as a familiar example of the
                    class of animated beings, which are the subjects of the following remarks. They
                    are all alike gelatinous and transparent, and many of them melt and flow away
                    when exposed in the air to the direct rays of the sun.</p>
                <p>Of all the tribes of Molluscae which are scattered over every part of the ocean,
                    the most splendid and best known is the Portuguese man-of-war (physalia). This
                    is an oblon animated sack of air, elongated at one extremity into a conical
                    neck, and surmounted by a membranous expansion running nearly the whole length
                    of the body, and rising above into a semicircular sail, which can be expanded or
                    contracted to a considerable extent, at the pleasure of the animal. From beneath
                    the body are suspended from ten to fifty or more little tubes, from half an inch
                    to an inch in length, open at the lower extremity, and formed like the flower of
                    the blue bottle. These have been regarded as temporary receptacles for food,
                    like the first stomach of cattle; but as the animal is destitute of any visible
                    mouth or alimentary canal, and as I have frequently seen fish in their cavities
                    apparently half digested, I cannot but consider them as proper stomachs; nor
                    indeed is it a greater paradox in Zoology that an animal should possess many
                    independent stomachs, than that the strange carnivorous vegetable, saricinea,
                    should make use of its leaves apparently for a similar purpose.</p>
                <p>From the centre of this group of stomachs, depends a little cord, never exceeding
                    the fourth of an inch in thickness, and often forty times as long as the
                    body.</p>
                <p>The size of the Portuguese man-of-war varies from half an inch to six inches in
                    length. When it is in motion, the sail is accommodated to the force of the
                    breeze, and the elongated neck is curved upwards, giving to the animal a form
                    strongly resembling the little glass swans which we sometimes see swimming in
                    goblets.</p>
                <p>It is not the form, however, which constitutes the chief beauty of this little
                    navigator. The lower parts of the body and neck are devoid of colour, except a
                    faint iridescence in reflected lights; and they are so perfectly transparent,
                    that the finest print is not obscured when viewed through them. The black
                    becomes gradually tinged, as we ascend, with the finest and most delicate blue
                    that can be imagined; the base of the scale equates the purest sky in the depth
                    and beauty of tint; the summit is of the most splendid red, and the central part
                    is shaded by a gradual admixture of these colours, through all the intermediate
                    grades of purples. Drawn as it were upon a groundwork of mist, the tints have an
                    aerial softness far beyond the reach of art, and warranting the assertion, that
                    they are often dressed in beauty before which the lily would fade, and the rose
                    hide its blushes, and producing some of the sublime phenomena when have
                    astonished the philosopher.</p>
                <p>The group of stomachs is less transparent, and although the hue is the same as
                    that of the back, they are on this account incomparably less elegant. By their
                    weight and form they fill the double office of a keel and ballast, while the
                    cord-like appendage, which floats cut for yards behind, is called by seamen the
                    cable.</p>
                <p>The mode in which the animal secures his prey, has been a subject of much
                    speculation; for the fish and crabs that are frequently found within the little
                    tubes are often large enough to tear them in pieces, could they retain their
                    natural vigour during the contest. Deceived by teh extreme pain which is felt
                    when the cable is brought in contact with the back of the hand, naturalists have
                    concluded, I think too hastily, that this organ secretes a poisonous or acrid
                    fluid, by which it benumbs any unfortunate fish, or other animal, that ventures
                    within its toils, allured by the hope of making a meal upon what, in its
                    ignorance, it has mistaken for a worm. The secret will be better explained by a
                    more careful examination of the organ itself. The cord is composed of a narrow
                    layer of contractile fibres, scarcely visible when relaxed, on account of its
                    transparency. If the animal be large, this layer of fibres will sometimes extend
                    itself to the length of four or five yards. A spiral line of blue bead-like
                    bodies, less than the head of a pin, revolves around the cable from end to end,
                    and under the microscope, these beads appear covered with minute prickles, so
                    hard and sharp that they will readily enter the substance of wood, adhering with
                    such pertinacity that the cord can rarely be detached without breaking.</p>
                <p>It is to those prickles that the man-of-war owes its power of destroying animals
                    which are its superiors in strength and activity. When anything becomes impaled
                    upon the cord, the contractile fibres are called into action, and rapidly shrink
                    from many feet in length to less than the same number of inches, bringing the
                    prey within reach of the little tubes, by one of which it is immediately
                    swallowed.</p>
                <p> This weapon, so insignificant in appearance, is yet sufficiently formidable even
                    to man. I had once the misfortune to become entangled with the cable of a very
                    large man-of-war, while swimming in the open ocean, and amply did it avence its
                    fellows, who now sleep in my cabinet robbed at once of life and beauty. The pain
                    which it inflicted was almost insupportable for some time, nor did it entirely
                    cease for twenty-four hours. </p>
                <p>I might now proceed to describe the many analogous animals scarcely inferior in
                    interest, but it is time to notice some individuals of another tribe, residing
                    beneath the surface, and therefore less generally known. </p>
                <p>The grandest of these is the beroe. In size and form it precisely resembles a
                    purse, the mouth, or orifice, answering to one of the modern metallic clasps. It
                    is perfectly transparent; and in order to distinguish its filmy outlines, it is
                    necessary to place it in a tumbler of brine held between the observer and the
                    light. In certain directions, the whole body appears faintly iridescent; but
                    there are several longitudinal narrow lines which reflect the full rich tints of
                    the rainbow in the most vivid manner, forever varying and mingling the hues,
                    even while the animal remains at rest. Under the microscope, these lines display
                    a succession of innumerable coloured scales, or minute fins, which are kept
                    unceasingly in motion, thus producing the play of colours by continually
                    changing the angle of reflection. </p>
                <p>The movements of the beroe are generally retrograde, and are not aided by the
                    coloured scales, but depend upon the alternate dilation and contraction of the
                    mouth. The lips are never perfectly closed, and the little fish and shrimps that
                    play around them are continually entering and leaving them at pleasure. The
                    animal is dependent for its food upon such semi-animated substances as it draws
                    within its grasp by moving slowly backwards in the water, and retains them in
                    consequence of their own feebleness and inability to escape the weakest of
                    snares.</p>
                <p>Another tribe of the sea purses, (Salpa,) though much smaller than the beroe, are
                    more complex in structure, and possess a higher interest in consequence of the
                    singular habits of some of the species. They are double sacks, resembling the
                    beroe in general form, but destitute of iridescence. The outer sack, or mantle,
                    rarely exceeds an inch in length, and is commonly about half as wide. The inner
                    sack is much smaller, and the interval between these forms a cavity for the
                    water which they breathe, and for some of the viscera. Their visible organs are,
                    a transparent heart, which can only be seen in the strongest light; a splendid
                    double row of whitish bead-like cavities, forming a spiral line near one
                    extremity, and supposed to be either lungs or ovaries; numerous broad flat
                    pearly muscles,</p>

                <p>I do not talk of mere beauty (continued Byron) of feature or complexion, but of
                    expression, that looking out of the soul through the eyes, which, in my opinion,
                    constitutes true beauty. Women have been pointed out to me as beautiful, who
                    never could have interested my feelings from their want of countenance; and
                    others, who were little remarked, have struck me as being captivating, from the
                    force of countenance. A woman’s face ought to be like an April day - susceptible
                    of change and variety; but sunshine should often gleam over it, to replace the
                    clouds and showers that may obscure its lustre, which, poetical description
                    apart, (said Byron,) in sober prose means, that good-humoured smiles ought to be
                    ready to chase away the expression of pensiveness or care that sentiment or
                    earthly ill calls forth. Women were meant to be the exciters of all that is its
                    finest in our natures, and the soothers of all that is turbulent and harsh. Of
                    what use, then, can a handsome automaton be, after one has got acquainted with a
                    face that knows no change, though it causes many? This is a style of looks that
                    I could not bare the sight of for a week, and yet such are the looks that pass
                    in society, for pretty, handsome, and beautiful. - Monthly Magazine. </p>

                <p> As onward press’d by gentle breeze, The ship glides proudly o’er the seas, And
                    leaves no path or trace behind, So heedless pass with rapid flight, And sink in
                    dark oblivion’s night, The fleeting visions of the mind.</p>

                <p>But when the storms in fury sweep The bosom of the raging deep, And sink the ship
                    beneath the main; Still may some plank float on to show The wreck that’s buried
                    far below The only vestige of the slain.</p>

                <p>Ostentatious dinners, where guests are bored to death with a profusion of
                    superfluous dishes, superfluous bottles, superfluous glasses, and superfluous
                    cut glass, and lumbering finery of all sorts, where the guests are invited and
                    estimated on the score of their purses; where the conversation consists of
                    dissertations on wines, and comparisons of the respective excellence of each,
                    and where the hired cook, after serving up the dishes, takes his place as a
                    waiter to eke out the scene of ostentation. </p>
                <p>Ostentatious parties, where ladies dress to fanaticism, and young gentlemen wear
                    black stocks and speckled stockings, where the finery is all borrowed or hired;
                    where you see the same hired waiters, the same great punch bowl, the same
                    everlasting lamps and the same desperate attempts at outdoing their rivals of
                    the ton; where the company is rated according to the Wall street standard and
                    the party according to the quantity of champaigne and pickled oysters. </p>
                <p>Married ladies dressed for a walk as if to an assembly, with gowns, the extreme
                    breadth and redundancy of whose folds are desperately contrasted with their
                    length, leading by the hand the little children so overloaded with finery that
                    they have no room to grow bigger, and never get to be more than four feet and a
                    half high. </p>
                <p>An affectation of contempt for every thing American, and of admiration for every
                    thing foreign; an affection of taste for Italian music without any taste; an
                    affectation of literature without any literature; an affectation of fashionable
                    manners without any manners; and a violent desire to be elegant without knowing
                    exactly how to go about it. Indeed no rusticity of manners is half so vulgar in
                    the eyes of people of real refinement as affectation.</p>

                <p>Yet the best blood by learning is refined, And virtue arms the solid mind; Whilst
                    vice will stain the noblest race, And the paternal stamp efface. -
                    OLDISWORTH.</p>
                <p>The inquiry, “should females receive as complete an education as males?” has been
                    the source of much speculation. It is an inquiry, the settlement of which
                    promises a signal triumph either to reason or bigotry. In former times, when
                    knowledge was less extensively diffused - when every useful and brilliant
                    production of genius lay unknown in the cloisters of ecclesiastical priesthood -
                    when the paeans of Sappho<note type="editorial">Sappho was an ancient Greek poet
                        who was known to be one of the greatest lyricist throughout time.</note> and
                    the elegies of Alcaeus were no longer sung - when the voice of Thalia
                    <note type="editorial">Thalia, also known as Thaleia, is one of the nine goddesses 
                        of music and dance. As the daughter of Zues, she was known as being the goddess
                        of comedic poetry.</note>
                    hushed, and the harp of Clio<note type="editorial">Clio, the daughter of Zeus, is 
                    one of the nine muses of Greek mythology. She is known for having discovered history 
                    and the arts of the guitar.</note> and hung mute and lifeless upon the willow - and when
                    the achievements of the hero and the martyrdom of the Christian, could only be
                    perpetuated by the legends of tradition - woman, lovely woman</p>
                <p>“Was doomed to slave of man to toil, Yoked with the beasts and fettered
                    soil.”</p>
                <p>But when the sun of knowledge began to diffuse his rays over the semi-barbarians
                    of Europe - dissipating the darkness of ignorance which covered them, and the
                    religion of the blessed Saviour began to be more extensively taught - her
                    condition was improved, and the smiles of her hope, her peace, and approaching
                    happiness, began to mingle with those of her beauty.</p>
                <p>With what reasoning are the enemies of female education able to satisfy their
                    minds? Some advance as an argument - an objection, carrying prejudice and
                    absurdity on its face - viz.: “The inability of woman - her want of mental
                    strength and influence, which are necessary to ensure success and usefulness.”
                    Those who take this position are opposing analog, past experience - the
                    fountains of experimental, unerring knowledge. Where are the sublime and useful
                    productions of Edgeworth? Where are the trophies of the genius of Opie, of
                    Hemans, of Hamilton, of De Stael and More? To borrow the words of Story, “man
                    can no longer boast of exclusive domination in authorship. He has rivals or
                    allies in almost every department of science, and they are to be found among
                    those whose elegance of manners and blamelessness of life, command his respect
                    as much as their talents excite his admiration. Who is there that does not
                    contemplate with enthusiasm the precious fragments of Elizabeth Smith, the
                    venerable learning of Elizabeth Carter, the elevated piety of Hannah More, the
                    persuasive sense of Mrs. Barbauld, the elegant memoirs of her accompliced niece,
                    the bewitching pictures of Madame D’Arblay, the vivid, picturesque, and terrific
                    imagery of Mrs. Radcliffe, the glowing poetry of Mrs. Hemans, the matchless wit,
                    the inexhaustible conversations, the fine character painting, the practical
                    instructions of Miss Edgeworth, the great Known, standing in her department by
                    the side of the great Unknown!”</p>
                <p>The same objection, which has been answered, might be urged against the general
                    education of males. How many are their among the males equally destitute of
                    strength of mind and those qualities which are necessary to command admiration!
                    The reason why there are more poets, orators, and philosophers, among men, is
                    because their education is an object of more care and attention. This education,
                    which could be the means of great good, is often, very often, perverted, and
                    applied to the more vicious and baneful uses. There are many, who, carrying with
                    them through life and the appellation of learned, gain an influence over the
                    minds of their contemporaries, which the glaring absurdity and vicious doctrines
                    with which their writings abound, are unable to erase when the hand of mortality
                    shall have seized them, and their bodies shall have crumbled into dust. This is
                    not the result of female education. Naturally chaste, modest, and unassuming -
                    having been taught when young that the beauty and worth of woman consist in
                    those qualities, improved and strengthened by polite literature, she aspires
                    after no higher honor than to be a source of pleasure and happiness to those
                    with whom she is connected, and a means of enjoyment to man, the partner of her
                    bosom - the author of her cares. She labors not for the fleeting honors of time,
                    but the moral tendency of her writings exhibits that they seek after a crown of
                    glory beyond the grave - “a crown, at the sight of which the diadems of the
                    Caears would sink to weeds.” Who, then can deny but what the literary
                    productions of women, (when influenced by such motives,) will be beneficial to
                    the males as well as their own sex? It is reasonable to believe that Paine would
                    have destroyed his own happiness, with that of many of his fellow creatures, had
                    he been blessed with a mother endowed with these heavenly feelings, and these
                    precious accomplishments. Hume and Voltaire, too, might perhaps (after living
                    long and useful lives) have sunk to the tomb, with the same feelings which
                    accompany the Christian in that frying hour - bearing with them their crowns of
                    bliss, and leaving behind the disciples of their usefulness to pay the last
                    tribute to departed greatness.</p>
                <p>The benefit originating from female productions is more plainly seen in the
                    effect they have on the young. The tender and tractable mind is easily
                    influenced by those writings, which are intended not simply to instruct, but
                    also to interest. It is argued by some, that the many vicious and obscene books
                    met with in the higher branches of literature, are calculated to have an
                    injurious effect on the morals of females; and for this reason there are many
                    who even go so far as to say, that their education should be restricted to
                    reading and writing, etc.; or should their education be prolonged or extended,
                    they should be robbed of every literary production not immediately connected
                    with their domestic affairs. That the reading of vicious books is calculated to
                    injure the morals, is what no one will pretend to deny; but that females, with
                    proper care, are much exposed to this evil, is much to be doubted. It is
                    supposed that, in the first place, parents endeavour to keep such books out of
                    reach of their children; and if this is not the case, the parents neglect the
                    performance of their duty. And if the character of females, when grown, is not
                    composed of modesty, chastity, affection, and every other virtue, we conclude
                    that the reason is, their parents were themselves destitute of the blessings of
                    polite literature; and had this not been the case, such would have been the
                    character of their children! Besides, the time is fast approaching when every
                    production calculated to injure the morals, will be excluded from the libraries
                    of the polite and patriotic. Great revolutions have taken place during the last
                    century, in relation to the worth of the productions of mind, as well as the
                    actions of the body. Mental struggles must have an umpire, as well as bodily;
                    and he who aspires after Tully’s “aliquid immensum que infinitum,” in oratory,
                    the “magister boni” of Horace, or the “sana mens in sano corpore” of Virgil,
                    must consent to submit to the scrutiny of the present, as well as hope for the
                    generosity of futurity. The empire of the mind will be triumphant. It must be
                    obvious, then, to every man, that such objections vanish when considerations
                    like these are fully examined.</p>
                <p>One of the greatest pleasures which man enjoys is conversation: and the pleasure
                    of conversation is certainly increased by an increase of knowledge. And why not
                    employ every means which are justifiable for the purpose of increasing the
                    pleasure of those whose cares are great, and whose worth (experience proves) has
                    never been duly appreciated? But, alas! such arguments as these are calculated
                    to have but little influence on those who inherit the cruelty of their fathers,
                    and who are always ready to resort to any means for destroying every vestige, of
                    justice and prostituting every call of humanity. And if it be granted that every
                    pursuit of females should be composed of innocence, virtue, and pleasure, what
                    employment is more applicable than the pursuit of literature? The best way to
                    destroy bice, is to place before it something more fascinating. Lay before
                    females, when young, something worth the application of their strongest
                    faculties - the employment of all their time - and there will be formed a more
                    impenetrable, a more insurmountable barrier against vice, than all the
                    exhortations which may be given by the philosophic tongue in after life. In
                    fact, this is necessary to produce that perfection which Cowper has expressed in
                    a few beautiful lines -</p>
                <l>“Her eye is meek and gentle, and a smile </l>
                <l>Plays on her lips; and in her speech is heard</l>
                <l>Paternal sweetness, dignity, and love.</l>
                <l>The occupation dearest to her heart</l>
                <l>Is to encourage goodness.”</l>
                <p>But the consideration which ought to have most influence in the examination of
                    this subject, remains yet to be mentioned. It is this - “if females were better
                    educated, the education of males would be improved,” - new lustré would be added
                    to their public and private careers, and new energy to their counsels. Take, for
                    instance, a man of high standing - a prince, a general, or any man whose
                    influence promises to be great - what would be the effect of his influence, if
                    destitute of moral instruction - destitute of maternal admonitions -
                    unacquainted with the solicitations of paternal affection, and deprived of the
                    blessings of learning? He spreads his influence - injurious and destructive - to
                    the most distant corners of his country. Thousands feel this influence;
                    thousands sink beneath the stroke of oppression. The empire of force is fast
                    fading from the face of the earth. The time is rapidly approaching when the
                    chains of tyranny will be broken - broken so hat no artist will be found
                    ingenious enough to mend them; and the spirit of free principle, of universal
                    liberty, will be seen ushering from the shades of darkness, the abodes of
                    ministerial oppression! Yes, the time is fast approaching when physical power
                    will be no longer required to lead man to the goal of prosperity. There will be
                    a mental government - a government of reason. All nature proves it.</p>
                <p>Why is it, that man will resist to the last grasp the had of the oppressor? What
                    is that for which man has been toiling from the time when he rose from his
                    cradle in the west, until he reached these last limits of his wanderings? Is it
                    a spirit which is leading him through morasses to the gibbet and the stake? Ask
                    the ruins of Athens - go thunder these questions among the hills where once
                    stood imperial Rome - the land of Brutus, the home of Cassius. Go ask the spirit
                    which hovers over the plains of Marathon; go inquire of those who are still
                    living monuments of our own glorious revolution, and an answer will be received
                    which none can doubt. If, the, this is to be the result of the labors of the
                    good and patriotic, are there not reasons why female education should be
                    improved? We know that the influence of woman is great. To them is left the
                    formation of the character; the turn of mind is always acquired from maternal
                    admonition. It is the infancy of man, when resting on the knees of the mother,
                    when those principles are implanted in his bosom, which, in after life, are to
                    sway the sceptre of despotism, or lead him to the temple of fame. There are many
                    striking examples of the influence of females over their husbands, and those
                    with whom they may be connected. When Bonaparte had extended his arms over
                    nearly the whole of Southern Europe, and had seen his colors flying triumphantly
                    over the walls of the capitol of Egypt, it was woman - the accomplished
                    Josephine<note type="editorial">Josephine was the first wife of  the famous 
                    Napoleon Bonaparte and the first empress of France. She was known widely for her 
                    magnificent gardens and her aid in Napoleon's political advances.</note> - who added 
                    vigor to his arm by her counsels, and infused mercy in his
                    bosom by her affectionate disposition. But though her influence was great, her
                    sufferings were soon disregarded. Such were her qualities, that had her
                    admonitions been listened to, had her sufferings been regarded, the conqueror of
                    conquerors might have died among the “vine hills of his own dear France,”
                    exulting in the triumph of liberty, the emancipation of Europe from civil and
                    religious despotism. But, alas! when he turned a deaf ear to her entreaties, his
                    honor, his power and happiness faded away like the dew drops of the morning. The
                    influence of the female is strikingly exhibited in the education of our immortal
                    Washington. The instructions which he received, when young, from his mother
                    <note type="editorial">Mary Ball Washington was the mother of the state’s first 
                    president, George, and five other children. Records indicate that her relationship 
                    with her famous son was quite complicated and strained.</note>,
                    were such as to enable him to lead our fathers through the doubtful period of
                    ‘76 - overcome the powers of temptation, and after having lived “the first in
                    war, the first in peace, and the first in the hearts of his countrymen,” to sink
                    in peace to the tomb, honored with the appellation of <emph rend="italics"
                        >“Father of his Country.”</emph></p>
                <p>Such is the effect of female influence, and such the force of female
                    accomplishments; and without these accomplishments, what would be the result of
                    female trials and female admonition? Here would rise a Cromwell, with hands
                    crimsoned with his country’s blood; there would be seen the car of a Caesar,
                    driving swiftly over the “forbidden Rubicon.” Here a Tiberius, hastening with
                    rapid strides to the goal of power; there a Sylla, trampling on the bodies of
                    his murdered countrymen, and rejoicing at the fall of liberty! With mother and
                    wife, gifted with all the accomplishments which polite literature, a due
                    cultivation of the mind, can afford, how happy is man! But deprived of these
                    -</p>
                <l>“Oh, what is man? - a world without a sun.</l>
                <l>And man, the hermit, sighed, till woman smiled.”</l>
                <p>What could have been expected, but that her situation would have called forth the
                    attention of men? But not so! For ages has she been regarded, not as the
                    messenger of glad tidings, but the object of hatred and oppression. Compelled in
                    some countries to toil with unceasing ardor in the bloom of youth, and linger
                    out her latter days in poverty and neglect. But with all this cruelty, she still
                    exclaims - </p>
                <l>“Man, with all thy faults I love thee still.” </l>
                <p>Unceasing in her love, uncorrupted in her morals, charitable in her affection -
                    abroad a friend and a comforter, at home a source of pleasure and delight - who
                    can not exclaim, with the genius of Moore:</p>
                <l>“Oh, woman! whose form and whose soul,</l>
                <l>Are the spell and the light of all we pursue!</l>
                <l>Whether sunned in the tropics, or chilled at the pole,</l>

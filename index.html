         <h3>To a Lady and Her Miniature</h3>
         
         
         <p>There is one spot to my memory dear,<br />Would that it were as dear to
            thine–<br />It is that spot where first I clasped<br />Thine own fair hand
            in mine.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is a spot o'er which is cast<br />Rememberance saddened by my
            tears–<br />One sunny spot–the first–the last–<br />Amidst
            the waste of blighted years.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is that spot where first I told thee,<br />The deep, pure love my bosom
            felt;<br />Thou did'st not then regard me coldly,<br />But smiled upon me as I
            knelt.
         </p>
         
         <p>Now, broken by thy thoughtless hand,<br />The spells thy love once round me
            threw,<br />Have passed the pictures, traced in sand–<br />Like summer
            clouds, or morning dew.

         <h3>Medusa.</h3>
         
         <p>An intelligent physician of Philadelphia<span class="ednote">NOTE<span class="ednotetext">Philadelphia,
                  Pennsylvania, United States</span></span> has furnished the best account of the
            Medusa, an order of animated beings but rarely described. We copy his account,
            which will be found highly interesting and graphic.
         </p>
         
         <p>Those who have sought relief from the summer heats at Long Branch or Cape May,
            have probably noticed, in their ramblings along the beach, certain gelatinous
            transparent masses deposited by the receding tide on the sands. They resemble
            very large plano-convex lenses, and are devoid of colour except in a few minute
            points, which appear like grains of yellow sand, or the eggs of some shells
            embedded in their substance. This has led many to consider them as the spawn of
            some marine animal.
         </p>
         
         <p> If one of these jellies be placed in a tub of brine immediately after it reaches
            the shore, the observer will be surprised to find it possessed of animation. The
            superior, or convex part, will expand like the top of an umbrella; and from its
            under surface several fringed and leaf-like membranes will be developed. The
            remains of numerous threads, or tendrils, will float out form the margin of the
            umbrella, following the motions of the animal as it swims around the tub. These
            threads are often several feel in length before they are broken by the sand;
            they are probably employed both to entice and to secure the prey, and they
            produce a sharp stinging sensation, when applied to the skin. It is from the
            appearance and offensive power of these last organs, that seamen have given the
            animal the title of the sea-nettle, and naturalists the generic name Medusa.
         </p>
         
         <p>I have offered this rude description of the Medusa, as a familiar example of the
            class of animated beings, which are the subjects of the following remarks. They
            are all alike gelatinous and transparent, and many of them melt and flow away
            when exposed in the air to the direct rays of the sun.
         </p>
         
         <p>Of all the tribes of Molluscae which are scattered over every part of the ocean,
            the most splendid and best known is the Portuguese man-of-war (physalia). This
            is an oblon animated sack of air, elongated at one extremity into a conical
            neck, and surmounted by a membranous expansion running nearly the whole length
            of the body, and rising above into a semicircular sail, which can be expanded or
            contracted to a considerable extent, at the pleasure of the animal. From beneath
            the body are suspended from ten to fifty or more little tubes, from half an inch
            to an inch in length, open at the lower extremity, and formed like the flower of
            the blue bottle. These have been regarded as temporary receptacles for food,
            like the first stomach of cattle; but as the animal is destitute of any visible
            mouth or alimentary canal, and as I have frequently seen fish in their cavities
            apparently half digested, I cannot but consider them as proper stomachs; nor
            indeed is it a greater paradox in Zoology that an animal should possess many
            independent stomachs, than that the strange carnivorous vegetable, saricinea,
            should make use of its leaves apparently for a similar purpose.
         </p>
         
         <p>From the centre of this group of stomachs, depends a little cord, never exceeding
            the fourth of an inch in thickness, and often forty times as long as the
            body.
         </p>
         
         <p>The size of the Portuguese man-of-war varies from half an inch to six inches in
            length. When it is in motion, the sail is accommodated to the force of the
            breeze, and the elongated neck is curved upwards, giving to the animal a form
            strongly resembling the little glass swans which we sometimes see swimming in
            goblets.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is not the form, however, which constitutes the chief beauty of this little
            navigator. The lower parts of the body and neck are devoid of colour, except a
            faint iridescence in reflected lights; and they are so perfectly transparent,
            that the finest print is not obscured when viewed through them. The black
            becomes gradually tinged, as we ascend, with the finest and most delicate blue
            that can be imagined; the base of the scale equates the purest sky in the depth
            and beauty of tint; the summit is of the most splendid red, and the central part
            is shaded by a gradual admixture of these colours, through all the intermediate
            grades of purples. Drawn as it were upon a groundwork of mist, the tints have an
            aerial softness far beyond the reach of art, and warranting the assertion, that
            they are often dressed in beauty before which the lily would fade, and the rose
            hide its blushes, and producing some of the sublime phenomena when have
            astonished the philosopher.
         </p>
         
         <p>The group of stomachs is less transparent, and although the hue is the same as
            that of the back, they are on this account incomparably less elegant. By their
            weight and form they fill the double office of a keel and ballast, while the
            cord-like appendage, which floats cut for yards behind, is called by seamen the
            cable.
         </p>
         
         <p>The mode in which the animal secures his prey, has been a subject of much
            speculation; for the fish and crabs that are frequently found within the little
            tubes are often large enough to tear them in pieces, could they retain their
            natural vigour during the contest. Deceived by teh extreme pain which is felt
            when the cable is brought in contact with the back of the hand, naturalists have
            concluded, I think too hastily, that this organ secretes a poisonous or acrid
            fluid, by which it benumbs any unfortunate fish, or other animal, that ventures
            within its toils, allured by the hope of making a meal upon what, in its
            ignorance, it has mistaken for a worm. The secret will be better explained by a
            more careful examination of the organ itself. The cord is composed of a narrow
            layer of contractile fibres, scarcely visible when relaxed, on account of its
            transparency. If the animal be large, this layer of fibres will sometimes extend
            itself to the length of four or five yards. A spiral line of blue bead-like
            bodies, less than the head of a pin, revolves around the cable from end to end,
            and under the microscope, these beads appear covered with minute prickles, so
            hard and sharp that they will readily enter the substance of wood, adhering with
            such pertinacity that the cord can rarely be detached without breaking.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is to those prickles that the man-of-war owes its power of destroying animals
            which are its superiors in strength and activity. When anything becomes impaled
            upon the cord, the contractile fibres are called into action, and rapidly shrink
            from many feet in length to less than the same number of inches, bringing the
            prey within reach of the little tubes, by one of which it is immediately
            swallowed.
         </p>
         
         <p> This weapon, so insignificant in appearance, is yet sufficiently formidable even
            to man. I had once the misfortune to become entangled with the cable of a very
            large man-of-war, while swimming in the open ocean, and amply did it avence its
            fellows, who now sleep in my cabinet robbed at once of life and beauty. The pain
            which it inflicted was almost insupportable for some time, nor did it entirely
            cease for twenty-four hours. 
         </p>
         
         <p>I might now proceed to describe the many analogous animals scarcely inferior in
            interest, but it is time to notice some individuals of another tribe, residing
            beneath the surface, and therefore less generally known. 
         </p>
         
         <p>The grandest of these is the beroe. In size and form it precisely resembles a
            purse, the mouth, or orifice, answering to one of the modern metallic clasps. It
            is perfectly transparent; and in order to distinguish its filmy outlines, it is
            necessary to place it in a tumbler of brine held between the observer and the
            light. In certain directions, the whole body appears faintly iridescent; but
            there are several longitudinal narrow lines which reflect the full rich tints of
            the rainbow in the most vivid manner, forever varying and mingling the hues,
            even while the animal remains at rest. Under the microscope, these lines display
            a succession of innumerable coloured scales, or minute fins, which are kept
            unceasingly in motion, thus producing the play of colours by continually
            changing the angle of reflection. 
         </p>
         
         <p>The movements of the beroe are generally retrograde, and are not aided by the
            coloured scales, but depend upon the alternate dilation and contraction of the
            mouth. The lips are never perfectly closed, and the little fish and shrimps that
            play around them are continually entering and leaving them at pleasure. The
            animal is dependent for its food upon such semi-animated substances as it draws
            within its grasp by moving slowly backwards in the water, and retains them in
            consequence of their own feebleness and inability to escape the weakest of
            snares.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another tribe of the sea purses, (Salpa,) though much smaller than the beroe, are
            more complex in structure, and possess a higher interest in consequence of the
            singular habits of some of the species. They are double sacks, resembling the
            beroe in general form, but destitute of iridescence. The outer sack, or mantle,
            rarely exceeds an inch in length, and is commonly about half as wide. The inner
            sack is much smaller, and the interval between these forms a cavity for the
            water which they breathe, and for some of the viscera. Their visible organs are,
            a transparent heart, which can only be seen in the strongest light; a splendid
            double row of whitish bead-like cavities, forming a spiral line near one
            extremity, and supposed to be either lungs or ovaries; numerous broad flat
            pearly muscles,

         <h3>Jeannie Morrison - Romantic Tale</h3>
         
         <p>I’ve wandered east, I’ve wandered west,
             Through mony a weary way: 
            But never, never can forget 
            The luve o’ life’s young day! 
            The fire that’s blawn on Beltane e’en, 
             May weel be black gin Yule; 
            But blacker fa’ awaits the heart 
             Where first fond luve grows cule. 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>O dear, dear Jennie Morrison, 
            The thoehts o’ bygane years 
            Still fling their shadows awer my path, 
             And blind my een wi’ tears; 
            They blind my een wi’ saut saut tears, 
             And sair and sick I pine, 
            As memory idly summons up 
             The blithe blinks o’ langsyne. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
            ‘Twas then we luvit ilk ither weel, 
             ‘Twas then we twa did part; 
            Sweet time - sad time! twa bairns at scule 
             Twa bairns and but ae heart! 
            ‘Twas then we sat on ae laigh bink, 
             To leir ilk ither lear; 
             And tones, and looks, and smiles were shed, 
            Remember’d evermair. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
            I wonder, Jeanie, aften yet, 
             When sittin on that bink, 
            Cheek touchin’ cheek, loof lock’d in loof, 
             What our wee heads could think? 
            When baith bent doun ower ae braid page, 
             Wi’ae buik on our knee, 
            Thy lips were on thy lesson, but 
             My lesson was in thee. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Oh, mind ye how we hung our heads, 
             How cheeks brent red wi’ shame, 
            Whene’er the scule-weans laughin said, 
             We cleek’d thegither hame? 
            And mind ye o’ the Saturdays, 
            (The scule then skail’t at noon,) 
            When we ran aff to speel the brues- 
             The broomy braes o’ June? 
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>My head rins round and round about, 
            My heart flows like a sea, 
            As ane by ane the thochts rush back, 
             O’ scule-time and o’ thee, 
            Oh, mornin’ life! oh, mornin’ luve! 
             Oh lichtsome days and lang, 
            When hinnied hopes around our hearts 
             Like simmer blossoms sprang. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Oh mind ye, luve, how aft we left 
             The deavin’ dinsome toun, 
            To wander by the green burnside, 
             And hear its water’s croon? 
            The simmer leaves hung ower our heads, 
             The flowers burst round our feet, 
            And in the gloamin’ o’ the wood, 
             The throssil whusslit sweet; 
         </p>
         
         <p>The throssil whusslit in the wood, 
             The burn sang to the trees, 
            And we with Nature’s heart in tune, 
             Concerted harmonies; 
            And on the knowe abune the burn,
             For hours thegither sat 
            In the silentness o’ joy, till baith 
             Wi’ very gladness grat. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Ay, ay, dear Jeanie Morrison, 
             Tears trinkled doun your cheek, 
            Like dew-beads on a rose, yet nane 
             Had ony power to speak! 
            That was a time, a blessed time, 
             When hearts were fresh and young, 
            When freely gush’d all feelings forth, 
             Unsyllabled - unsung! 
         </p>
         
         <p>I marvel, Jeanie Morrison, 
             Gin I hae been to thee 
            As closely twined wi’ earlieast thochts, 
             As ye hae been to me? 
            Oh! tell me gin their music fills 
             Thine ear as it does mine; 
            Oh! say gin e’er your heart grows grit 
             Wi’ dreamings o’ langsyne? 
         </p>
         
         <p>I’ve wander’d east, I’ve wander’d west, 
             I’ve borne a weary lot; 
            But in my wand’rings far or near. 
             Ye never were forgot. 
            The fount that first burst frae this heart, 
             Still travels on its way; 
            And channels deeper as it rins, 
             The luve o’ lifes’ young day. 
         </p>
         O dear, dear Jeanie Morrison, 
          Since we were sindered yaung, 
         I’ve never seen your face, nor heard 
          The music o’ your tongue; 
         But I could hug all wretchedness, 
          And happy could I die, 
         Did I but ken your heart still dream’d 
          O’ bygane days and me!

         <h3>BYRON’S OPINION OF BEAUTY.</h3>
         
         <p>I do not talk of mere beauty (continued Byron) of feature or complexion, but of
            expression, that looking out of the soul through the eyes, which, in my opinion,
            constitutes true beauty. Women have been pointed out to me as beautiful, who
            never could have interested my feelings from their want of countenance; and
            others, who were little remarked, have struck me as being captivating, from the
            force of countenance. A woman’s face ought to be like an April day - susceptible
            of change and variety; but sunshine should often gleam over it, to replace the
            clouds and showers that may obscure its lustre, which, poetical description
            apart, (said Byron,) in sober prose means, that good-humoured smiles ought to be
            ready to chase away the expression of pensiveness or care that sentiment or
            earthly ill calls forth. Women were meant to be the exciters of all that is its
            finest in our natures, and the soothers of all that is turbulent and harsh. Of
            what use, then, can a handsome automaton be, after one has got acquainted with a
            face that knows no change, though it causes many? This is a style of looks that
            I could not bare the sight of for a week, and yet such are the looks that pass
            in society, for pretty, handsome, and beautiful. - Monthly Magazine.

         <p>Ostentatious dinners, where guests are bored to death with a profusion of
            superfluous dishes, superfluous bottles, superfluous glasses, and superfluous
            cut glass, and lumbering finery of all sorts, where the guests are invited and
            estimated on the score of their purses; where the conversation consists of
            dissertations on wines, and comparisons of the respective excellence of each,
            and where the hired cook, after serving up the dishes, takes his place as a
            waiter to eke out the scene of ostentation.

         <p>Ostentatious parties, where ladies dress to fanaticism, and young gentlemen wear

            they have no room to grow bigger, and never get to be more than four feet and a

         <h3>FEMALE EDUCATION.</h3>
         
         <p>Yet the best blood by learning is refined, And virtue arms the solid mind; Whilst
            vice will stain the noblest race, And the paternal stamp efface. -
            OLDISWORTH.
         </p>
         
         <p>The inquiry, “should females receive as complete an education as males?” has been
            the source of much speculation. It is an inquiry, the settlement of which
            promises a signal triumph either to reason or bigotry. In former times, when
            knowledge was less extensively diffused - when every useful and brilliant
            production of genius lay unknown in the cloisters of ecclesiastical priesthood -
            when the paeans of Sappho<span class="ednote">NOTE<span class="ednotetext">Sappho was an ancient Greek poet
                  who was known to be one of the greatest lyricist throughout time.</span></span> and
            the elegies of Alcaeus were no longer sung - when the voice of Thalia was
            hushed, and the harp of Clio hung mute and lifeless upon the willow - and when
            the achievements of the hero and the martyrdom of the Christian, could only be
            perpetuated by the legends of tradition - woman, lovely woman
         </p>
         
         <p>“Was doomed to slave of man to toil, Yoked with the beasts and fettered
            soil.”
         </p>
         
         <p>But when the sun of knowledge began to diffuse his rays over the semi-barbarians
            of Europe - dissipating the darkness of ignorance which covered them, and the
            religion of the blessed Saviour began to be more extensively taught - her
            condition was improved, and the smiles of her hope, her peace, and approaching
            happiness, began to mingle with those of her beauty.
         </p>
         
         <p>With what reasoning are the enemies of female education able to satisfy their
            minds? Some advance as an argument - an objection, carrying prejudice and
            absurdity on its face - viz.: “The inability of woman - her want of mental
            strength and influence, which are necessary to ensure success and usefulness.”
            Those who take this position are opposing analog, past experience - the
            fountains of experimental, unerring knowledge. Where are the sublime and useful
            productions of Edgeworth? Where are the trophies of the genius of Opie, of
            Hemans, of Hamilton, of De Stael and More? To borrow the words of Story, “man
            can no longer boast of exclusive domination in authorship. He has rivals or
            allies in almost every department of science, and they are to be found among
            those whose elegance of manners and blamelessness of life, command his respect
            as much as their talents excite his admiration. Who is there that does not
            contemplate with enthusiasm the precious fragments of Elizabeth Smith, the
            venerable learning of Elizabeth Carter, the elevated piety of Hannah More, the
            persuasive sense of Mrs. Barbauld, the elegant memoirs of her accompliced niece,
            the bewitching pictures of Madame D’Arblay, the vivid, picturesque, and terrific
            imagery of Mrs. Radcliffe, the glowing poetry of Mrs. Hemans, the matchless wit,
            the inexhaustible conversations, the fine character painting, the practical
            instructions of Miss Edgeworth, the great Known, standing in her department by
            the side of the great Unknown!”
         </p>
         
         <p>The same objection, which has been answered, might be urged against the general
            education of males. How many are their among the males equally destitute of
            strength of mind and those qualities which are necessary to command admiration!
            The reason why there are more poets, orators, and philosophers, among men, is
            because their education is an object of more care and attention. This education,
            which could be the means of great good, is often, very often, perverted, and
            applied to the more vicious and baneful uses. There are many, who, carrying with
            them through life and the appellation of learned, gain an influence over the
            minds of their contemporaries, which the glaring absurdity and vicious doctrines
            with which their writings abound, are unable to erase when the hand of mortality
            shall have seized them, and their bodies shall have crumbled into dust. This is
            not the result of female education. Naturally chaste, modest, and unassuming -
            having been taught when young that the beauty and worth of woman consist in
            those qualities, improved and strengthened by polite literature, she aspires
            after no higher honor than to be a source of pleasure and happiness to those
            with whom she is connected, and a means of enjoyment to man, the partner of her
            bosom - the author of her cares. She labors not for the fleeting honors of time,
            but the moral tendency of her writings exhibits that they seek after a crown of
            glory beyond the grave - “a crown, at the sight of which the diadems of the
            Caears would sink to weeds.” Who, then can deny but what the literary
            productions of women, (when influenced by such motives,) will be beneficial to
            the males as well as their own sex? It is reasonable to believe that Paine would
            have destroyed his own happiness, with that of many of his fellow creatures, had
            he been blessed with a mother endowed with these heavenly feelings, and these
            precious accomplishments. Hume and Voltaire, too, might perhaps (after living
            long and useful lives) have sunk to the tomb, with the same feelings which
            accompany the Christian in that frying hour - bearing with them their crowns of
            bliss, and leaving behind the disciples of their usefulness to pay the last
            tribute to departed greatness.
         </p>
         
         <p>The benefit originating from female productions is more plainly seen in the
            effect they have on the young. The tender and tractable mind is easily
            influenced by those writings, which are intended not simply to instruct, but
            also to interest. It is argued by some, that the many vicious and obscene books
            met with in the higher branches of literature, are calculated to have an
            injurious effect on the morals of females; and for this reason there are many
            who even go so far as to say, that their education should be restricted to
            reading and writing, etc.; or should their education be prolonged or extended,
            they should be robbed of every literary production not immediately connected
            with their domestic affairs. That the reading of vicious books is calculated to
            injure the morals, is what no one will pretend to deny; but that females, with
            proper care, are much exposed to this evil, is much to be doubted. It is
            supposed that, in the first place, parents endeavour to keep such books out of
            reach of their children; and if this is not the case, the parents neglect the
            performance of their duty. And if the character of females, when grown, is not
            composed of modesty, chastity, affection, and every other virtue, we conclude
            that the reason is, their parents were themselves destitute of the blessings of
            polite literature; and had this not been the case, such would have been the
            character of their children! Besides, the time is fast approaching when every
            production calculated to injure the morals, will be excluded from the libraries
            of the polite and patriotic. Great revolutions have taken place during the last
            century, in relation to the worth of the productions of mind, as well as the
            actions of the body. Mental struggles must have an umpire, as well as bodily;
            and he who aspires after Tully’s “aliquid immensum que infinitum,” in oratory,
            the “magister boni” of Horace, or the “sana mens in sano corpore” of Virgil,
            must consent to submit to the scrutiny of the present, as well as hope for the
            generosity of futurity. The empire of the mind will be triumphant. It must be
            obvious, then, to every man, that such objections vanish when considerations
            like these are fully examined.
         </p>
         
         <p>One of the greatest pleasures which man enjoys is conversation: and the pleasure
            of conversation is certainly increased by an increase of knowledge. And why not
            employ every means which are justifiable for the purpose of increasing the
            pleasure of those whose cares are great, and whose worth (experience proves) has
            never been duly appreciated? But, alas! such arguments as these are calculated
            to have but little influence on those who inherit the cruelty of their fathers,
            and who are always ready to resort to any means for destroying every vestige, of
            justice and prostituting every call of humanity. And if it be granted that every
            pursuit of females should be composed of innocence, virtue, and pleasure, what
            employment is more applicable than the pursuit of literature? The best way to
            destroy bice, is to place before it something more fascinating. Lay before
            females, when young, something worth the application of their strongest
            faculties - the employment of all their time - and there will be formed a more
            impenetrable, a more insurmountable barrier against vice, than all the
            exhortations which may be given by the philosophic tongue in after life. In
            fact, this is necessary to produce that perfection which Cowper has expressed in
            a few beautiful lines -
         </p>
         “Her eye is meek and gentle, and a smile 
         Plays on her lips; and in her speech is heard
         Paternal sweetness, dignity, and love.
         The occupation dearest to her heart
         Is to encourage goodness.”
         
         <p>But the consideration which ought to have most influence in the examination of
            this subject, remains yet to be mentioned. It is this - “if females were better
            educated, the education of males would be improved,” - new lustré would be added
            to their public and private careers, and new energy to their counsels. Take, for
            instance, a man of high standing - a prince, a general, or any man whose
            influence promises to be great - what would be the effect of his influence, if
            destitute of moral instruction - destitute of maternal admonitions -
            unacquainted with the solicitations of paternal affection, and deprived of the
            blessings of learning? He spreads his influence - injurious and destructive - to
            the most distant corners of his country. Thousands feel this influence;
            thousands sink beneath the stroke of oppression. The empire of force is fast
            fading from the face of the earth. The time is rapidly approaching when the
            chains of tyranny will be broken - broken so hat no artist will be found
            ingenious enough to mend them; and the spirit of free principle, of universal
            liberty, will be seen ushering from the shades of darkness, the abodes of
            ministerial oppression! Yes, the time is fast approaching when physical power
            will be no longer required to lead man to the goal of prosperity. There will be
            a mental government - a government of reason. All nature proves it.
         </p>
         
         <p>Why is it, that man will resist to the last grasp the had of the oppressor? What
            is that for which man has been toiling from the time when he rose from his
            cradle in the west, until he reached these last limits of his wanderings? Is it
            a spirit which is leading him through morasses to the gibbet and the stake? Ask
            the ruins of Athens - go thunder these questions among the hills where once
            stood imperial Rome - the land of Brutus, the home of Cassius. Go ask the spirit
            which hovers over the plains of Marathon; go inquire of those who are still
            living monuments of our own glorious revolution, and an answer will be received
            which none can doubt. If, the, this is to be the result of the labors of the
            good and patriotic, are there not reasons why female education should be
            improved? We know that the influence of woman is great. To them is left the
            formation of the character; the turn of mind is always acquired from maternal
            admonition. It is the infancy of man, when resting on the knees of the mother,
            when those principles are implanted in his bosom, which, in after life, are to
            sway the sceptre of despotism, or lead him to the temple of fame. There are many
            striking examples of the influence of females over their husbands, and those
            with whom they may be connected. When Bonaparte had extended his arms over
            nearly the whole of Southern Europe, and had seen his colors flying triumphantly
            over the walls of the capitol of Egypt, it was woman - the accomplished
            Josephine - who added vigor to his arm by her counsels, and infused mercy in his
            bosom by her affectionate disposition. But though her influence was great, her
            sufferings were soon disregarded. Such were her qualities, that had her
            admonitions been listened to, had her sufferings been regarded, the conqueror of
            conquerors might have died among the “vine hills of his own dear France,”
            exulting in the triumph of liberty, the emancipation of Europe from civil and
            religious despotism. But, alas! when he turned a deaf ear to her entreaties, his
            honor, his power and happiness faded away like the dew drops of the morning. The
            influence of the female is strikingly exhibited in the education of our immortal
            Washington. The instructions which he received, when young, from his mother,
            were such as to enable him to lead our fathers through the doubtful period of
            ‘76 - overcome the powers of temptation, and after having lived “the first in
            war, the first in peace, and the first in the hearts of his countrymen,” to sink

         <p>Such is the effect of female influence, and such the force of female
            accomplishments; and without these accomplishments, what would be the result of
            female trials and female admonition? Here would rise a Cromwell, with hands
            crimsoned with his country’s blood; there would be seen the car of a Caesar,
            driving swiftly over the “forbidden Rubicon.” Here a Tiberius, hastening with
            rapid strides to the goal of power; there a Sylla, trampling on the bodies of
            his murdered countrymen, and rejoicing at the fall of liberty! With mother and
            wife, gifted with all the accomplishments which polite literature, a due
            cultivation of the mind, can afford, how happy is man! But deprived of these

         <p>What could have been expected, but that her situation would have called forth the
            attention of men? But not so! For ages has she been regarded, not as the
            messenger of glad tidings, but the object of hatred and oppression. Compelled in
            some countries to toil with unceasing ardor in the bloom of youth, and linger
            out her latter days in poverty and neglect. But with all this cruelty, she still
            exclaims -

         “Man, with all thy faults I love thee still.” 
         
         <p>Unceasing in her love, uncorrupted in her morals, charitable in her affection -
            abroad a friend and a comforter, at home a source of pleasure and delight - who
            can not exclaim, with the genius of Moore:
         </p>
         “Oh, woman! whose form and whose soul,
         Are the spell and the light of all we pursue!
         Whether sunned in the tropics, or chilled at the pole,
         If woman be there, there is happiness too!”

         <h3>The Mother's Decision.</h3>
         By Mrs. H. M. Dodge.
         
         Theirs was a melancholy pledge,
          A dark and bitter token,
         Of joys which never could return--
          Of hearts by sorrow broken!
         They gazed upon the seal of wo,
          With red and tearless eye,
         And bosoms throbbing deep and wild
          With speechless agony!
         
         
         Is this the gift? Aye, is this all
         `A mother's heart could bring
         For her own cherished, worshipp'dchild--
          Its proudest offering?
         All--is it all?--a seal of wo--
          A stern command to part!
         Ah, mother, didst thou never weigh
          The treasures of the heart?
         
         
         Unhappy mother, wretched child, 
          Your days of joy are o'er;
         Maternal pride and filial love
          Can never mingle more!
         That stern command, that dark decree,
         Has seal'd her gloomy fate;
         And Calvary's holy voice of love,
         Alone shall quell her hate.
         Philadelphia, June 20th, 1833.
